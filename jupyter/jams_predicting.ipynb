    "# Traffic jams and predicting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Detect current traffic jams from the NDW speed feed and build a predictive model that forecasts whether a jam will occur in the near future (e.g. next 5–30 minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data used\n",
    "- Real-time / historical measurements: `df_speed`, `df_speed_enriched`, `df_speed_mega_enriched`\n",
    "- Site/location info: `df_sites`, `df_sites_parsed`, `gdf_sites`, `gdf_sites_rd`\n",
    "- Road segments / geometry: `gdf_speedloc`, `gdf_msi`, `gdf_join`\n",
    "- Paths: `csv_path`, `output_dir`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detection (rule-based baseline)\n",
    "- Simple threshold rule to label jam events:\n",
    "    - low-speed: `avg_speed_kmh < speed_thresh` (e.g. 30 km/h)\n",
    "    - optionally require flow > `min_flow` to ignore closed lanes (e.g. 50 veh/h)\n",
    "    - or sudden drop: `speed_now < (1 - drop_pct) * historical_median_speed`\n",
    "- Temporal consolidation:\n",
    "    - require at least `min_duration` consecutive measurements (e.g. 10–15 min) per `site_id` to form a jam\n",
    "    - merge adjacent sites on same road/km to form an event\n",
    "- Candidate API: `detect_jams(df, speed_thresh=30, min_flow=50, min_duration=10) -> jams_df`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Label creation for ML\n",
    "- Use the detection output to create binary labels:\n",
    "    - label = 1 if a jam occurs within prediction horizon (e.g. next 5/15/30 minutes)\n",
    "- Join labels back to measurement times per `site_id` for supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature engineering\n",
    "- Instant features: `avg_speed_kmh`, `flow_veh_per_hour`\n",
    "- Temporal features: rolling means / std (5, 15, 30 min), `speed_delta` (now − prev), time of day, weekday\n",
    "- Spatial context: lane, `road`, `km`, neighboring sites' speeds (upstream/downstream)\n",
    "- Historical features: median speed by site/hour (seasonality)\n",
    "- Categorical encoding: `road`, `carriageway`, `lane`, `direction_ref`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling approach\n",
    "- Baseline: logistic regression / calibrated probability\n",
    "- Tree-based: RandomForest, XGBoost or LightGBM for performance\n",
    "- Handle class imbalance: class_weight, focal loss, oversample minority or undersample majority\n",
    "- Cross-validation: time-series CV (no leakage) — use rolling-window splits\n",
    "- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1, PR-AUC (prefer PR when classes are imbalanced), ROC-AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline (high-level)\n",
    "1. `jams_df = detect_jams(df_speed_mega_enriched, ...)`\n",
    "2. `labels = create_labels(jams_df, horizon='15min')`\n",
    "3. `X, y = build_features(df_speed_mega_enriched, labels, windows=[5,15,30])`\n",
    "4. Train model with time-series CV:\n",
    "     - `model = train_model(X_train, y_train, model='lgbm', eval_metric='pr_auc')`\n",
    "5. Predict on live feed and save:\n",
    "     - `preds = model.predict_proba(X_live)[:,1]`\n",
    "     - save to `output_dir / \"ndw_jam_predictions.csv\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization / inspection\n",
    "- Map jams and probabilities with geopandas (use `gdf_sites` / `gdf_sites_rd` geometry)\n",
    "- Time series per site: plot speed + predicted jam probability\n",
    "- Aggregate on road segments (`km`) and show current jam extents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick checklist for next code cells\n",
    "- Implement `detect_jams(...)` using `df_speed_mega_enriched`\n",
    "- Build `build_features(...)` leveraging rolling windows (pandas `.groupby('site_id').rolling(...)`)\n",
    "- Train with a lightweight model (e.g. LightGBM) and validate with time-based splits\n",
    "- Create plotting cell: map jam events using `gdf_sites` or `gdf_join` and color by probability\n",
    "- Save labels/predictions to `output_dir`\n",
    "\n",
